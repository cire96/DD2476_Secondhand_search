The truck is equipped with a 8.3L viper engine. This is the real deal SRT10 and not a clone like others. You don\u2019t see many of these around anymore. The truck has about 106k miles and it is a salvage title. The truck runs excellent and shifts great. No check engine light. The truck was recently smogged in about December and it passed with flying colors. The tags were also just paid and are good till next year. Just recently did a oil change also.\nNow the cons of the truck:\n-Truck will need tires and alignment soon \n- radio does not work \n- abs and brake light are on due to speed sensor \n- some miscellaneous parts need to be put on the front end (ac condenser, bottom grills, windshield washer fluid container) \n- Minor scrapes on front passenger fender \nI drive the truck everyday even with the cons; it doesn\u2019t affect the way it drives. This is not your average truck please research it before contacting me. I\u2019m asking 12,500 FIRM. Pink in hand. No, I will not take anything less and please don\u2019t waste your time trying to offer anything less than that. I will keep the truck if I don\u2019t get what I\u2019m asking. This is the cheapest SRT10 that is for sale. \nTRUCK IS LOCATED IN CLOVIS, CA    "}

Source: Edmunds* If you want a heavy-duty truck engineered to give you the power you need and deliver it in a gorgeous package, look no further than the Ram 3500. With its signature rounded curves and huge front grille, this truck is instantly recognizable and respected wherever it goes. All Ram 3500s come standard with a 5.7L HEMI V8 with 38hp, 400 lb-ft of Torque and a 6-Speed Automatic Transmission. Plus, you have the option to choose the available 6.4L HEMI V8 or the 6.7L Turbo Diesel instead. Ram also gives you other transmission choices as well. On all 3500 sizes and trims you have the option to choose a 6-Speed HD Automatic or a 6-Speed Manual with Overdrive. The exception to this is the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Crew Cabs and Mega Cabs, which do not have the manual as an option. Plus, all Ram 3500s give you the option of two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. Standard on all trims are Anti-Lock Brakes and Stability Control. With Pickups, storage space is always handy. Ram has reserved a very special option, the innovative RamBox Cargo Management System, which is included when you purchase either of the Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims. The interior of the 3500 is a beautiful combination of strength and refinement. The environment has a polished feel even on the base trims. The regular cab can seat 3 on a bench, and the 4-door versions can either seat 5 when there are two-bucket seats up front, or 6 people on 2 rows. For those who love technology, the Laramie Longhorn Edition and Laramie Longhorn Limited Edition Trims have a combination of 3 powerful tools: A GPS Navigation System, Rear Park Assist, and a Rear View Camera.

It is also more refined, more efficient and more capable than the other trucks in its segment. Source: KBB.com* Comfortable but confident ride quality; many available high-tech features; fuel-efficient engines; classy-looking interior; maneuverable size. Source: Edmunds* With advanced technology to keep you connected, great fuel efficiency, the Chevrolet Colorado is all that you want in a truck. Chevrolet is redefining the midsize pickup from the frame up. Under the hood you can choose from the choice of 2 engines including a 2.5L that produces 200hp and 191lb-ft of torque or a 3.6L V6 that produces 305hp and 269lb-ft of torque with best-in-class 26 MPG hwy fuel economy. It achieves this by implementing innovative powertrain technologies like Spark Ignition Direct Injection and deceleration fuel cutoff, which shuts off fuel to the engine when braking. With the available trailering package, this small truck is rated to tow up to 7,000 lbs. The Colorado small truck offers a Z71 Off-Road Package with precisely tuned suspension that provides an incredibly stable and comfortable ride for off-road performance. The Z71 package also includes an automatic locking rear differential, which sends power to one of the rear wheels when the other one loses traction to help you stay in control.

We have been huge fans of this SUV.  Hence why we are buying another.  Kelly Blue Book Private Party for Very Good condition averages $27,872.  With a range of $26,371 - $29,372 (See attached pic).  If we step this down to \"Good\", KBB is still $26,506.  Of course a clean title.  I have the AutoCheck report from KBB for anyone who would like to see it.  \n\nVIN: 5XYPKDA56HG336431\n\n\nThis car has:\n- 3.3-liter GDI dual CVVT 6-cylinder V6 engine\n- Under 42,000 miles\n- Adaptive Cruise or Active Cruise and follows the car in front of your\n- Lane Departure Warning\n- Blind spot detection\n- Rear Cross Traffic Alert (RCTA)\n- Really nice Rear Parking Assist System \n- Forward Collision Warning System\n- Apple Car Play and Android Auto\n- Great Infinity surround sound audio with 10 speakers and amp\n- Lockable AWD.  Much like a 4WD system.  One of the few SUV\u2019s that has this.\n- 3 rows (third row) for 7 passengers\n- Power driver and passenger seats with heat and cooling\n- 3rd row control AC\n- USB port in 2nd row\n- 3 - 12 volt accessory plugs\n- 120v plug in the 2nd row\n- Cargo cover \n- Electronic parking brake\n- Hill-start Assist Control (HAC)\t\n- Automatic foldable mirrors\n- Panoramic sunroof with power shade\t\n- 2nd-row sunshade screen\t\n- 2nd-row arm rest with cup holder\n- Smart Power liftgate with programmable operation\n- Color is Snow White Pearl\n\nI have all the oil and filter change records.  The SUV has always had full synthetic.  The tires are in great shape.  Original stickers and manuals included.  The condition is really great.  I would say the interior is excellent and the exterior is good to excellent.  The bumper covers have a few minor imperfections.  The wheels have no curb rash.  The car is very clean and detailed.  RainX applied to the windshield and a new synthetic oil change.  Never smoked in.  Never in an accident.  \n\nI just paid off the lien on this car from Kia Motor Financials.  The final payment cleared on the 21st of April.  I am still waiting for the new title from the DMV.  If you want to get the car before the the title arrives, I can show you the full payoff from Kia.  We can execute a \u201cBill of Sale\u201d.  Then get a Temporary Operating Permit as I understand.  If payment is not in the form of Cash\u2026I will accept a cashier\u2019s check, but in that case we will finish the paper work and transfer at your bank that is issuing the check.  This is helpful if you are getting a loan out for the car.  We can also use an escrow service to help with the transfer.    "}

I did add a voltage gauge to measure the O2 sensor output and some various other electrical values from the engine. Other than that I just kept tweaking things that go wrong after 25 years.

The other three have good thread.\n\n* Disc brake conversion in the back. You need to have 'thin' pads put in or have different rims or put spacers in.

I'll get back to you as soon as I can, which can be a while, because of other demands I have on my time.\n\nQuestions I have gotten:\n\n1. Rust. There is a bit of light rust on some of the seams. It hasn't gotten worse in the time I've owned the van. No bubbles as far as I can see.\n\n2. Under the van I don't remember any rust. I spent a bit of time under there. I do think it had an undercoating at some point. Not sure if that makes things better or worse.\n\nThanks,\nMark    "}

Mostly original other than an aftermarket lift kit by second owner, and a Tuffy console and LED headlights I installed. Updated many parts and had some parts sandblasted and powder coated to get the look I wanted. Like most Land Cruisers in the Bay Area, it has been to Mudrack for diagnosis and tune-up. I run premium fuel only and use Amsoil XL engine oil. It has areas with some surface rust and where the previous owner did some poor patch up work and repainting. Overall it's a pretty solid and great looking vehicle that doesn't need much. Since 2017 it has spent most of its life in the Bay Area going to car shows, coffee runs and cruising around. But it has been parked during the pandemic at the farm and only driven to get mail. A box with spare parts and original center console will be included. Please respond via CL email. Thank you.\n\nProvident Credit Union is the leinholder so I don't have the title in hand. The smoothest transaction is to bring your check or cash payable to Provident CU with me and they will work directly with you to transfer title to you or your bank. If you need financing, Provide CU offers great rates.    "}

I recently had the paint lightly corrected and had a top local PDR guy go over all panels and remove any minor dings. Only one ding near gas filler was unreachable. The hood was repainted by prior owner due to rock chips, and was done extremely well (currently has a few small rock chips). I had the front bumper repainted last year when a broken mounting tab was repaired. All four wheels have recently been professionally refinished and have no curb rash. Also note that the MINI was de-badged in the rear by a prior owner. The headlights are perfectly clean and clear. Car is always garaged. The interior, carpet and seats are in excellent condition as shown in pictures. It has an aux cable to the H/K stereo that can be used with a Bluetooth player.\n\nMechanical\nThe MINI runs very strong and there are no oil leaks or drops under the car. Oil pan gasket, valve cover gasket were replaced around 80,000 miles. No dash lights on, A/C works well. A summary spreadsheet of maintenance performed since 46,000 miles is available. Recent significant cost items (over $5K total) addressed and upgraded (at mileage noted) include:\n\n\u00b7        88,200 \u2013 New front and rear brake rotors, pads and sensors (JCW)\n\u00b7        92,300 \u2013 New Valeo single mass clutch and flywheel; new axles\n\u00b7        92,500 \u2013 New tires (4) - 215/40 R18 Bridgestone Potenza RE980 AS\n\u00b7        92,600 \u2013 New battery\n\u00b7        93,400 \u2013 All (4) wheels professionally refinished\n\u00b7        94,100 \u2013 Suspension refreshed: All new Koni Special Active FSD shocks/struts (4), Ireland Engineering fixed camber plates (2), a new WMW 22\u201d hollow rear sway bar, and a full four-wheel alignment\n\nOther\nI have a Carfax available. No accidents or major damage noted. It reports \"minor damage\" on the front bumper by CA inspection, which is in reference to the bumper noted above that I had repaired and repainted (the prior owner clipped a parking pylon). Clean and clear CA title in hand.\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful MINI that is ready to drive and enjoy for many miles. I have owned it for about a year. I put a lot of time and $$ into it with plans to make it a long-term keeper. However, I stumbled upon a very unique car and am selling only to chase a unicorn.\n\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, congratulations!

The wheels are 17x7 with a +35mm offset and a 4x98 bolt pattern. The wheels will come with the tires that were on it when I removed the wheels from my car as well as all 4 TPMS sensors which are still fully functioning.\n\nThe wheels are used but in great shape aside from the fact that the previous owner decided it was a good idea to rattlecan the wheels matte black which is beginning to flake off a little (not sure if it was spraypaint or plastidip). Would make a great set if you wanted to clean them up and have them powdercoated or you can run them as they are because it's not too noticeable.\n\nThe front tires still have a bit of tread but the rears should be replaced because they are pretty bald. Tires in the front are Falken ZIEX ZE950 and the rears are Toyo Extensa HP. All 4 tires are 205/40/R17.\n\nShoot me an offer!\n\nThanks,\nMitch    "}
