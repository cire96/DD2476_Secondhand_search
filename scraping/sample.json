These British cars are amazing. Haven't had it for long, no problems so far and drove it around the city and to the East Bay plenty of times. The guy I got it from is a mechanic and installed a new slave cylinder and gave it a general work-over. Body is pretty great save for a nasty spot below driver's side door. Interior isn't bad either, carpeting in good shape, MG mudrugs, original tan upholstery. Salvage title though I've been told the car wasn't in an accident (and priced accordingly). Unclear whether odometer rolled over, but from what I know it was just a little town car in Concord for most of its life. The clutch needs some attention (probably just a thorough bleeding), as well as some dash electrical. \n\nThought I had time for a little toy, classic car- but life changed and I got laid off and have some new priorities.

With the scraps already there, you don\u2019t need to worry about the new ones. There was a previous accident before my ownership, but has zero impact on drivability or reliability - it was 100% fixed with a brand new radiator and AC condenser and fans. Being an original SF car paint and dash slightly faded UV. No issues all up to date on maintenance.

I purchased this car brand new in November 2018 and since then, it's evolved into a fully set up track car. Car has approx. ~11,350 miles. I'm selling since I just bought a F80 M3 and am finding I am no longer using this car. This car would be perfect for anyone looking to have a low cost car that they would like to track or if you'd like to invest a little bit more to convert to a full race car. The car has ~$20k just in parts for mods. This was the Club package w/ Brembo brakes. This car is registered in CA but airbags sensor is not plugged in - so buyer should trailer it home.\n\nPlease see the list of mods -- the top things I'd call out are:\n-Car has no functional airbags due to installation of bucket seats/unplugging the sensor\n-It's a custom 15\" drivers seat from Kirkey, not everyone will fit. It should be easy to replace this & happy to inquire if needed\n-Everything in car is still functional (including soft top) except the bluetooth speakers in the stock Recaro seats are no longer there. This just prevents being able to have voice calls. Car does have Apple carplay\n\n-Ceramic Coating Gold Pkg + windows tinted \n-Blackbird Fabworx ND RZ Rollbar \n-AiM Smarty Cam HD + AiM Solo DL 2 (completely set up w/ external mic)\n-RoadsterSport Miata Front Shock Tower Brace\n-Oil Catch Can\n-RoadsterSport Race Exhaust\n-Verus Engineering Rear Diffuser\n-Verus Engineering ND Brake Cooling Kit (removed foglights for brake duct)\n-Verus Engineering ND Underbody Panels\n-Techna-Fit SS brake lines\n-Voodoo Knob Magnum Black Nob\n-Stubby antenna\n-Carbon Miata Spyder Grille\n-CarbonMiata front + rear tow hooks (gold coated)\n-Kirkey Racing race seat 45 for Driver (15\" -NOTE: not everyone will fit in this)\n-Kirkey Racing race seat 65 for Passenger (16\")\n-Schrotch racing harness 6 pt belt harness\n-\"Hidden Hitch\" by Hard Dog  (still installed, can be used to tow trailer with wheels)\n-MCS 2WNR Dampers with Hyperco 625/300 springs\n-Karcepts front subframe reinforcement\n-Karcepts front camber bushings\n-Karcepts Front Sway (0.188\") + Rear Sway (0.095\")\n-235/40/17 NT01s (40% left) on Bronze 17x9 949Racing 6UL wheels (I suggest running NT01s or slicks for current spring/suspension setup)\n\nCar is setup to run low 1:44s at Laguna\n\nAs I mentioned, no expense was spared & the car is perfectly setup and good to go!

Boggs raced funny cars from coast to coast during the years 1969 to 1985. The first funny car Ezra raced was the Colt 45 machine of the Martin Brothers. The Martin Brothers were the third owners in the line of cars bearing the Colt 45 name. The first owners were the successful Ingram and Davis team out of California who built the first Colt 45 in 1966 to race in the NHRA AA/A class. The team then raced early funny cars with the blown steel body car. Davis and Ingram sold the car to Frank Reinauer, who bought the car to match race in the Oklahoma area.\n\nReinauer extended the front end 24 inches and replaced the small block with a 396 Chevy. The car never handled well so Reinauer had local funny car racers Gitthens and Allen build a new chassis from 2 x 4\" square tubing. A new '69 Mustang body was ordered from Ron Pellegrini's Fiberglass, Ltd., shop outside Chicago. Frank drove the new car a couple of times but still did not like the feel of it. He sold the car to fellow Oklahomans Don and Jack Martin and Reinauer asked Ezra to drive the car for the new owners. Boggs drove the 480 cubic inch Chevy powered Mustang for two years with best times of 7.70 at 198 in 1970.

It's a solid frame with independent suspension all around.  Includes a 2003 Mustang Cobra independent rear end.  Front suspension is out of a C-6 corvette.  Has rack and pinion installed.  He is an engineer and used CAD software to design the frame.  Parts were designed in software and cut out in water jet machine.  \n\nSuspension, frame, brakes, brake lines are completed.  Body work is mostly completed except front nose.  \n\nThe original owner made molds for front nose, hood, and front inner fender wells.

Front inner fenders are carbon fiber and already made.\n\nAll trim pieces are included from the original El Camino.  Same with glass.  \n\nWheels and front brakes are from a c-6 corvette.  Rear brakes are from the mustang.\n\nI don't know everything about this car because there's a lot of details.
