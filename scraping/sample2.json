These British cars are amazing. Haven't had it for long, no problems so far and drove it around the city and to the East Bay plenty of times. The guy I got it from is a mechanic and installed a new slave cylinder and gave it a general work-over. Body is pretty great save for a nasty spot below driver's side door. Interior isn't bad either, carpeting in good shape, MG mudrugs, original tan leather/corduroy upholstery. Salvage title though I've been told the car wasn't in an accident (and priced accordingly). Unclear whether odometer rolled over, but from what I know it was just a little town car in Concord for most of its life. \n\nJust had master cylinder replaced. Burns a little oil (she's an oldie), and although all lights work, some dash electrical needs attention.\n\nThought I had time for a little toy, classic car- but life changed and I got laid off and have some new priorities. Looking to place it in the hands of someone who can appreciate it and give it the TLC and time to really cherry it out!\n\nNo low ballers but serious offers entertained, contact me for a test drive, hoping to pass this beauty along sooner rather than later. I'm in the Outer Sunset of SF, by the beach. $6000 or best offer, VERY motivated to sell, payment by cash or Zelle preferred. Not interested in trades.    "}

Car is awesome value, so $3,500 firm!\n\nThis Scion has been a beast for both me and my brother/sister-in-law, who purchased it almost 10 years ago. \n\nI was originally planning to keep it in SF, so just re-registered it, put on a new windshield, new front and back wipers, new headlights etc! Just passed smog.\n\nThis vehicle currently has zero mechanical problems and has never required more than oil changes and rare tire swaps. Wouldn't be surprised if this car is just getting warming up! Check out the custom red engine bar in pics.\n\nThere was some light paint top coat peeling years ago, and we started using nano diamond shield and carnauba wax to freeze it's state. You just need to occasionally wipe it down and I'll include the product with sale. Obviously some paint dings on a 2006, but from a distance looks great.\n\nIf you want to take the car to a mechanic to review before purchase, that is not an issue at all. Please pick a spot between Marina district and Japantown and we can meet there.\n\nIn the sale I will also include two simple roof rack bars!\n\nI am in no major hurry to sell, but can give her up in the coming week.  Cheers!    "}

These British cars are amazing. Haven't had it for long, no problems so far and drove it around the city and to the East Bay plenty of times. The guy I got it from is a mechanic and installed a new slave cylinder and gave it a general work-over. Body is pretty great save for a nasty spot below driver's side door. Interior isn't bad either, carpeting in good shape, MG mudrugs, original tan upholstery. Salvage title though I've been told the car wasn't in an accident (and priced accordingly). Unclear whether odometer rolled over, but from what I know it was just a little town car in Concord for most of its life. The clutch needs some attention (probably just a thorough bleeding), as well as some dash electrical. \n\nThought I had time for a little toy, classic car- but life changed and I got laid off and have some new priorities. Looking to place it in the hands of someone who can appreciate it and give it the TLC and time to really cherry it out!\n\nNo low ballers but serious offers entertained, contact me for a test drive, hoping to pass this beauty along sooner rather than later. Happy to use my Triple A towing to get it to you as well. I'm in the Outer Sunset of SF, by the beach. $6000 or best offer, VERY motivated to sell, payment by cash or Zelle preferred. Not interested in trades.    "}
